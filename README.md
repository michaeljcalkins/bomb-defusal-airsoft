# Bomb Defuse for Airsoft

Terrorists are trying to plant a bomb at one of two bomb sites.  The Counter-Terrorists must stop them from planting the bomb by defusing it or eliminating all Terrorists.

## Rules
- Everyone has one life.  Adjust number of lives for depending on your audience.
- Terrorists spawn the furthest from bomb sites.
- Counter-Terrorists spawn the closest to bomb sites.
- Teams can be 5 - 8 players.
- Each round is 5 minutes.
- You may only arm the bomb if you are holding the bomb at the bomb site.
- You must stop arming the bomb when shot.

## How Counter-Terrorists Win
- Run down the round timer without the Terrorists ever planting the bomb.
- Defuse the bomb after it has been planted.
- Eliminate all Terrorists (not available after the bomb has been planted).

## How Terrorists Win
- Plant the bomb explosive and run down its 40 second countdown without the Counter-Terrorists defusing it.
- Eliminate all Counter-Terrorists.

## Field Setup
- Both bomb sites should be as far from each other as possible while still giving Counter-Terrorists the reasonable ability to get to each first from the start of the round.
- Counter-Terrorist spawn should be close to the bomb sites but still require them to travel.
- Terrorist spawn should be the furthest from the bomb sites.
